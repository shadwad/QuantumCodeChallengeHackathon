# Quantum Code Challenge Hackathon / Smart City QC Wizard Challenge
Quantum Code Challenge Hackathon for Smart Cities at CTE - Cagliari Digital Lab

[Quantum Code Challenge](https://www.cagliaridlab.it/en/event.page?contentId=EVT881) is a entirely online hackathon on quantum computing applied to smart cities in the [CTE Cagliari DLAB](https://www.cagliaridlab.it/) project framework, organised by [CRS4](https://www.crs4.it/) in collaboration with [Open Campus](https://www.opencampus.it/) and with the endorsement of [Qitaly](https://qworld.net/qitaly/), the italian representative among the national active groups of the QWorld organization.
The event takes place entirely online from 22 to 25 October 2024!
